### Project Title  
Explore US Bikeshare Data  

### Description  
This project analyzes bikeshare data for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The script bikeshare.py allows users to filter the data by city, month, and day of the week to compute and display various statistics such as:
- The most frequent times of travel
- The most popular stations and trip
- Trip duration statistics
- User info and demographics (where available)

The script is interactive and runs via the terminal, prompting the user for inputs before performing the analysis.

### Files Used
